## DESCRIPTIONS
_this page is a conclusion about the course "[Web Applications Security](http://websec.prof.ninja/)" I have taken in 2017 fall semester and I think this is a good journey in my life_.


## SKILLS
_1.The ability in LAMP(Linux,Apache,Mysql,PHP) stack;<br>
2.The ability in MEAN(MongoDB,ExpressJS,AngularJS,Node.js) stack;<br>
3.The ability in Serverless-Stacks(FireBase);<br>
4.the ability in different attacks(XSS,CSRF,SQL injection);<br>_


## PROJECTS

**Project 1**._The first project is about the a Text-twist game, we build this project based on LAMP stack based HTML, MYSQL, CSS, PHP and Javascript, I think this project is a basic project for a beginner to show them how a page can work, like what should we do if we want to modify the  page structure or how to make the page more beacutiful and also how a click can trigger a function, in a word, doing this project can give you a very basic idea about how to build a web page and how a web works.<br>
See more detail about this game on github:[Text-Twist Game](https://github.com/superlll/test_twist).<br>
or doing following command in your bash:<br>_
`git clone https://github.com/superlll/test_twist.git`


**Project 2**._The second project is degelop a Login System based on MEAN stack, becasue the LAMP stack first in my mind, things going to be more easier because I can map the MEAN to LAMP and that's will make you more quick to understand how a MEAN stack works, our project achieve these functions: 1.login, 2.register, 3.change password, 4.show detail about a user history and 5.Oauth Github. What's more, we also encrypt the user's password for security;<br>_
_See more detail about this project on github:[Login-System](https://github.com/superlll/LoginSystem).<br>
or doing following command in your bash:<br>_
`git clone https://github.com/superlll/LoginSystem.git` 


**Project 3**. _The last project is what you see now, I develop a page though github and publish it to my own domain which is bought from [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), using the github to publish a page is convenience, you don't need to care about any things about code or sytle, even you do not need to bought a domain, the github offer a free one. If you want to pulish the page to your own domain, you just need to do some extra work;_ <br>


## ACHIEVEMENTS:<br>

_Personally, I prefer the MEAN stack, that's because the MEAN make things easy, I can use a single language "javascript" rather "PHP + javascript", also the mongoDB is friendly. What's more, the node.js has so many powerful npm which surprice me;_<br>
_if you just need to build a self page, I think use the github is a good way, you don't need to be an expertise in CSS and you can get a beautiful page by yourself._
