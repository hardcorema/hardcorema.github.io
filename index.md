## DESCRIPTIONS
_this page was build by a beginner of a web developer in the end of 2017, I would like to make a conclusion about what I got in the course "Web Applications Security".


## SKILLS
_1.The ability in LAMP(Linux,Apache,Mysql,PHP) stack;<br>
2.The ability in MEAN(MongoDB,ExpressJS,AngularJS,Node.js) stack;<br>
3.The ability in Serverless-Stacks(FireBase);<br>
4.the ability in different attacks(XSS,CSRF,SQL injection);<br>


## PROJECTS

**Project 1**._The first project is about the a Text-twist game, we build this project based on LAMP stack based HTML, MYSQL, CSS, PHP and Javascript, I think this project is a basic project for a beginner to show them how these five parts work together, like what should we do if we want to modify the  page structure or how to make the page more beacutiful and also how a click can trigger a function, in a word, doing this project can give you a very basic idea about how a web can be built and how a web works.<br>
you can download this project from my github:_<br>
_[Text-Twist Game](https://github.com/superlll/test_twist)._<br>
_or do command: "git clone https://github.com/superlll/test_twist.git" _in bash


**Project 2**._The second project is build a Login System web page based on  MEAN stack, becasue the LAMP stack first in my mind, things going to be more easier to understand because I can map the MEAN to LAMP and that's  will make you more quick to understand how a MEAN stack works, our project achieve these functions:login,register,change password and Oauth Github. What's more, we also encrypt the user's password for security;<br>
you can download this project from my github:<br>
[Login-System](https://github.com/superlll/LoginSystem).<br>
or do command: "git clone https://github.com/superlll/LoginSystem.git" in bash_


**Project 3**. _The last project is what you see now, I publish a page though github, the domain name is bought from NameCheap, use the github to publish a page will be convenience, you don't need to care about any code or sytle, even you do not need to bought a domain, the github offer it. If you want to pulish the page to your own domain, you just need to do some extra work;_ <br>


## ACHIEVEMENTS:<br>
_Personally, I prefer the MEAN stack more, that's because the MEAN make things easy, I can use a single language "javascript" rather "PHP+javascript", also, the mongoDB is friendly. What's more, the node.js has so much powerful npm which surprice me;_<br>
_if you just need to build a self page, I think use the github is a good way, it not require you to be an expertise, what you need to learn just how to build a page by github and how to publish this page to your own domain;_
